# 00: Command Line Interface (CLI)

Welcome to [bigdata-mindstorms/node-playground](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/node-playground). 

In this course we will learn [node.js](https://nodejs.org) together from **scratch**. No previous experience is 
required but you should be willing to learn everything that is needed along the way. 

To make it easy to fit into your busy work/school schedule, our lessons are designed in a way that you will 
spend less than 30 minutes everyday on it. Go slowly and steadily. (Remember :rabbit: + :turtle: ? :wink:)

Now let's set up command line workflow.

- For OS X users, you already have a terminal. Use  ⌘+space to open Spotlight and type `terminal` to launch it.

- For Windows users, you have three options:
  + install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
  + install a [Linux virtual machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 
  + install [docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)

- For Linux users, you already know what to do. :smile:

Get yourself familiar with command line interface (CLI). Practice how to 
launch and quit terminal app in your computer. Try a few harmless commands like following:

- start a shell called `bash`

input
```shell
16:46 $ bash
```

output
```shell
✔ ~ 
```

- go to home directory

input
```shell
16:46 $ cd
```

output
```shell
✔ ~ 
```

- show the name of current directory (which is the home directory if we do not change it)

input
```shell
16:46 $ pwd
```

output
```shell
/Users/ontouchstart
✔ ~ 
```

- find current time

input
```shell
16:46 $ date
```

output
```shell
Mon Feb 29 16:46:26 EST 2016
✔ ~ 
```

- exit `bash`

input
```shell
16:46 $ exit
```

output
```shell
exit
✔ ~ 
```

- type another `exit` to exit terminal app.

Please follow my examples and post your questions, test input and output in markdown format in the 
[lesson issue](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/node-playground/issues/2). Your output will be different
than mine. Please learn to copy and paste the text from your terminal into markdown as input/output code block 
(you can copy and paste them later for other purposes).

Don't worry about node.js yet. Again, :rabbit: + :turtle: .
